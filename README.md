Reflections & Future Opportunities
Opportunity for Better Integration:

Add infrared sensors to detect user proximity (suggested during critique).

Trigger dynamic effects based on user interaction beyond button/knob.

Explore better handcraft techniques or light diffusion materials.

Learning Points:

Moving from 3D printing to handcrafting opened more flexibility.

Importance of color tuning for emotional design.

State management in hardware systems mirrors app logic, but with unique physical challenges.
